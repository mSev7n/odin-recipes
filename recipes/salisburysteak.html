    <h3>Description: <p>Salisbury steaks with a savory onion sauce. This yummy recipe has been in my family for years. It's easy to cook but tastes like it took hours to make! I usually make enough extra sauce to pour over mashed potatoes.</p></h3>
    <h4>Ingredients: <ul>
        <li>Beef: This Salisbury steak recipe starts with 1.5 pounds of ground beef.</li>
        <li>Canned soup: A can of condensed French onion soup adds moisture, richness, and flavor to the patties. It also serves as the base for the gravy.</li>
        <li>Bread crumbs: Bread crumbs give the patties structure.</li>
        <li>Egg: An egg helps hold the patties together.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: These easy Salisbury steaks are simply seasoned with salt and black pepper. Mustard powder enhances the flavor of the gravy.</li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour thickens the gravy.</li>
        <li>Sauces: You'll need ketchup and Worcestershire sauce.</li>
    </ul></h4>
    <h4>Steps: <ol>
        <li>Make and shape the patties.</li>
        <li>Brown the patties on both sides, then drain the excess fat.</li>
        <li>Make and season the gravy.</li>
        <li>Pour the gravy over the patties and continue cooking until the meat is cooked through.</li>
    </ol></h4>
